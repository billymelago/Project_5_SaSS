# Project_5_sass
Css to SaSS
In this project you will convert a CSS stylesheet to Sass. You'll refactor the stylesheet from the "Responsive Layout" project using SCSS partials, variables, extends, and mixins.

In the 'scss' folder, create subfolders to organize your CSS code into Sass partial files.
Group related sections of CSS into SCSS partials.
Import your partials into your project's main SCSS file.
Find repeating patterns in the stylesheet and extract them into placeholder selectors, then extend them wherever necessary.
Create variables for repeating values.
Write mixins for ALL media queries.
